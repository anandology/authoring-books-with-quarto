Here is how you do it with Quarto.\nTypically, when there are multiple parts, it is a good idea to create a directory for each part and add a file with name index.qmd as the description of the part.\nSupport we want to add a part with title Animals with chapters for Elephants, Tigers and Lions.\nThe first thing to do is a to create a directory structure as follows.\nanimals/\n├── elephants.qmd\n├── index.qmd\n├── lions.qmd\n└── tigers.qmd\nThe animals/index.qmd file will be something as follows.\n# Animals\n\nThis part describes about various animals.\nOnce we create all the files and add titles, we can list them in the _quarto.yml file as follows.\nbook:\n  title: \"My Awesome Book\"\n  author: \"Norah Jones\"\n  date: \"11/2/2023\"\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - part: animals/index.qmd\n      chapters:\n        - animals/elephants.qmd\n        - animals/tigers.qmd\n        - animals/lions.qmd\n    - summary.qmd\n    - references.qmd"
